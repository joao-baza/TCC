# 🌐 Educational Simulator for Unit Operations

Final project in Chemical Engineering at UFMS, developed by **João Pedro Baza Garcia Rodrigues** [[LinkedIn]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-baza/) under the guidance of **Prof. Celso Murilo dos Santos** [[LinkedIn]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/celso-murilo-dos-santos/). The code can be tested online [here](https://tcc.homelab.sistemasj.com.br) - (last update: 2025-11-15)

## Academic Context
- Final project proposing a free web software for simulation and dimensioning of unit operations.

- Motivation: To democratize calculation tools used in chemical projects, reducing dependence on expensive software such as Aspen Plus®, HYSYS®, or ChemCAD®.

## Introduction, Justification, and Objectives
- **Introduction**: Sizing chemical process equipment requires mastery of mass/energy balances, thermodynamics, heat/mass transfer, and chemical kinetics. The system integrates these concepts into an accessible application.

- **Justification**: Institutions without commercial licenses lack didactic platforms. The open solution allows for active learning, real-time visualization of results, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

- **General Objective**: To offer a modular web software for calculating and sizing unit operations, using client-server architecture and an open API.

- **Specific Objectives**:
1. Implement classic sizing routines (heat exchangers, columns, absorption, evaporation, reactors, piping).
2. Develop a responsive and user-friendly web interface.
3. Integrate local database of physicochemical properties (initially hardcoded) and scientific libraries.
4. Validate results with literature and commercial tools to ensure reliability.

## Didactic Purpose
- Supports case studies that connect theory (balances, kinetics, flow) with modern computational implementation.

- Encourages open contributions to expand property catalogs, new process modules, and comparative studies with proprietary software from scholars in both chemical engineering and software.

## TODO:
- CAPE-OPEN
- Removal of hardcoded values

1. Maximum conversion value by Brent method

2. Characteristics, properties, and schedules of piping
